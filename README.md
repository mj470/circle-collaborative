## Description 
We imagined an idea of creating a space where future developers like us, could get together and share tech related content. After we brainstormed about where it could go, we expanded the idea to take the place of a social network where users could connect through a variety of shared interests and hobbies, find online communities to interact with.

Circle is a social media platform where users can create and join “circles” as a means of interacting with people that have similar interests. We believe our project takes inspiration from the likes of Reddit’s subbreddits with how groups are made and interact with each other as well as the look of sites like Twitter, Facebook, and Pintrest for a visually appealing user interface.


## Features
This application is fully responsive and mobile friendly. It has the functionality for a user to login or signup and view their profile page. The profile page populates with the username and the groups associated with that user. A logged in user can join groups to see content as well as create new "circles" for other users to join. Groups or Circle Groups are identified by an image, a unique name, and a short description. All Circle groups can be seen on the Circle Groups page. The navbar also has links to contact us as well as an about us page from the developers of the application. The navbar is avalible on every page and can link to any of the other pages. The navbar also allows a user to logout from any page. 

Pages:
-Home page with login/logout/signup fields
-Profile page includes username and associated circle groups
-Circle Groups page lists all avaliable groups and a field for logged in users to create new groups
-Contact Us page for user feedback
-About Us page about the developers
-Navbar that loads on everypage
